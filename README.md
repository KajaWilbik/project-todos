# Project Todos

Week 11 Technigo Bootcamp - Redux. Simple to do list developed in React and Redux. Styling with styled components.

## The problem

The biggest problem was to understand where data is store when I add a new task and how to count how many object is in array. I solved the problems by using Redux Devtool as well as asking group and coding mentors about specific problems.

Update in project:

1. Added Lotties animation
2. Styling and make it responsive

Things that need to be fixed:

1. Completed tasks counter
