# Project Todos
Week 11 Technigo Bootcamp - Redux. Simple to do list developed in React and Redux. Styling with styled components. 

## The problem

The biggest problem was to understand where data is store when I add a new task and how to count how many object is in array. I solved the problems by using Redux Devtool as well as asking group and coding mentors about specific problems. 

The project is not yet done. I need to work on:
1. Styling, right now is not fully responsive and need to be updated
2. I would like to add button that will aloud to print the list with date. 
3. Congratulation alert when you checked all tasks
